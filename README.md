# billiard-ball-detection
This repository contains a project for the digital image processing course at Bogazici University. It focuses on detecting balls from a video captured by a stationary camera and generates a trajectory for the white ball.


## Project Descriptions
- Detect table corners
- Detect moving balls in the table
- Store the positions of the moving balls
- Draw a fitted line showing the path of the moving balls


## Here is an example
